## Logging In
To log in, you must first create an account. Your account must contain a username, your full name, and a valid password. The password must contain up to 8 characters, at least 1 capital letter, and at least 1 special character (such as !, @, #, etc.). Make sure that you enter a password that you'll remember!

## Logging Off
To log off of your account, select on the "Logout" button located on the top right side of the site.

Be careful about pressing the "Logout" button if you do not mean to, as you'll need to login again if you do.

## Account Information
In order to view your account info, select the tab "Account" tab. In this tab, you'll be able to edit your profile credentials including your Name, email address, your personal market ID, and your password (please notes that your password must still abide by the security criteria established in the Login section).
    
To confirm your changes, select the "SUBMIT" button and your account will record the new data you've changed. If you change your mind about the changes you made, select the "CANCEL" button to revert your changes.

In order to view the main information for each of the available stocks, select the "Data" tab and then select the "Stock Data" button in the dropdown menu. This will show you the important information regarding each stock that is available.

If you wish to stay up to date with your account's risk and and your position. The provided snippet displays an example of what's available, you'll only get to see what your own account's information.

## Buying/Selling Stocks
If you wish to buy or sell a stock, select the "Orders" tab to access a dropdown menu. From here, you can select "Buy" to find the following page:

From here, you can then input the stock information you're interested in bidding. You have to input the quantity of the stock, the associated stock's ID (for example, Microsoft's ID is MCFT), the type of stock you'll bid (either "market" or "limit"), and finally, the price that you're willing bid for the stock.

Keep in mind that you can only input valid information that can be found in the Data tab. For instance, you cannot input more of what the quantity of a stock currently has or bid a negative price.

If you wish to sell a stock that you currently own, you may select the "Sell" button found either in red text above the dropdown options or in the "Orders" tab again and select "Sell" from there.

The option to offer a stock works very similarly to the "Buy" tab, as it allows you to sell any stocks you currently own and submit an order to offer that stock. Keep in mind that you cannot input any information that is not accurate to what stocks you own. In other words, you cannot offer a stock you haven't bid yet and you cannot offer a stock for a negative price.

Additionally, you can also look up information regarding each stock in the market with the "Book" tab. Selecting "Book" will show you all currently available bids and offers. You can use this tab as a reference when buying or selling a stock in case you need more information about it.
